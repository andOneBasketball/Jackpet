During the Arbitrum APAC Mini Hackathon, Jackpet has achieved a set of concrete, production-oriented milestones that demonstrate both technical depth and real-world feasibility:

1. We designed and implemented the complete Jackpet smart contract architecture on Arbitrum, including a luck-based on-chain game engine, a flexible reward rule system, and a multiplier-based gameplay mechanism. All game logic is fully enforced on-chain, ensuring transparency and determinism.

2. We integrated Chainlink VRF to provide provably fair, auditable, and censorship-resistant randomness for each game round. Every outcome can be independently verified on-chain, reinforcing fairness and trust for all players.

3. A secure jackpot pool mechanism has been fully implemented at the contract level. Funds accumulated in the jackpot pool are strictly restricted by smart contract rules and cannot be withdrawn by any individual, including the project team. This guarantees strong fund safety, transparency, and trust minimization.

4. We built a functional frontend prototype that connects directly to the deployed contracts, allowing users to connect wallets, initiate gameplay, and view results and rewards through on-chain data, completing the full end-to-end user flow.

5. The system has been deployed and tested on Arbitrum test networks with real transactions, validating contract logic, reward settlement, and jackpot distribution under realistic conditions.

6. Beyond the hackathon scope, we have established a clear roadmap toward further UI polish, expanded gameplay mechanics, and eventual mainnet deployment, with the long-term goal of incubating Jackpet into a sustainable, fair, and community-driven on-chain gaming product.
